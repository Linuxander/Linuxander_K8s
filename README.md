This repository hosts some of the Kubernetes manifest files I used when I had my website deployed on DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster.

# Digital Ocean Cloud Platform
- DNS
  - Configured domain name records with load balancer IP
- DigitalOcean Kubernetes Service (DOKS)
  - Where I deployed the Kubernetes cluster
- LoadBalancer
  - Generated by ingress-nginx helm deployment


# Backend Web Framework
- Django Web Framework
  - Rendered HTML
  - Displayed dynamic content from MySQL DB
  - Customized CMS schema where I had control over what items was published
  - Leveraged Django's admin authentication feature


# Containerization
- Docker
  - Django Image
  - MySQL


# Orchestration
- Kubernetes
  - Pod Deployments
    - Django app
    - MySQL
  - Security
    - Network Policy's
      - Deployed deny all policy for each namespace
      - Configured policies granting specific access accordingly


# Secrets

NOTE: I only used secrets for exploratory purposes.  It's recommended to create a side-car pod that fetches your credentials from the credentials manager associated with the cloud platform you deploy this in.  (and remember: encoding is not encryption)

- Django
  - Django Secret Key
    - Stored it as a secret for exploratory purposes
    - Mounted it into the Django pod as a file
    - Django settings parsed the contents of this file
    - Set secret key volume mount's readonly property to true for security
    - This method keeps sensitive data out of your Docker image
- MySQL
  - Init SQL
    - A file that contained predefined database, tables, users, and user permissions
    - Injected this file at in the MySQL pod as `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`
    - This init sql file runs when MySQL pod starts
    - Django pod would then be able to connect to this pod since the database and users are already set
- DockerHub Secrets
  - Used by the Django deployment file to fetch the Django Docker image


# Helm
- Ingress-NGINX
  - Deployed ingress-nginx using helm
    - Generated a DigitalOcean Load Balancer (with IP) allowing me to expose my internal Kubernetes app to the outside world
  - Configured with an issuer resource to route traffic to and from the nginx load balancer and the Django's service resource
- Cert-Manager
  - Configured with issuer resource that requested SSL certificates from LetsEncrypt
  - Debugged a challenging issue as the DigitalOcean documentation was missing critical settings that was preventing automatic SSL certificate renewal from LetsEncrypt


# Monitoring & Alerting
- Explored DataDog, Prometheus, and Grafana deployments using Helm to see how monitoring worked and to visualize its data


# DevOps CI/CD
- Bitbucket
  - Repository
  - Pipelines
    - Customized Symantic Versioning system where code merged in specific branches would increment a specific version number
    - Used this version number to tag Docker images
    - Build Docker images and deploy them to DockerHub
- Jenkins (exploration)
  - Pipelines
    - Explored deploying the entire CI portion as AWS resources
      - VPC networking
      - EC2 Jenkins Server
    - Bitbucket Hooks
      - Configured Bitbucket hooks to trigger the Django Docker image build in Jenkins
      - Configured Jenkins to deploy Docker image to DockerHub
